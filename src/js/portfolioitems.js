Since then I've added a features to turn it into a useable tool for DJs and music enthuisasts to fully utalise the Spotify recommendations API. On the spotify desktop application they dont allow you to change specific recommendation parameters such as BPM, key and danceability. This is is a frontend with controls for that API, built on react and redux.",

        "Laura Stout is a professional animator and illustrator. She needed a website to help her find new animation projects. Using influence and aspects of her previous work, we worked together to create a beautiful yet simple design with correctly represented her style. Due to the simplicity of Laura's site, an application framework wasn't requried. Instead I took the opportunity to delve into Static Site Generation with Gatsby and React. Using Netlify's CMS and graphQL queries, I was able to build a system in which Laura can edit and add additional content. For styling I chose styled-components as it works will with Gatsby's component driven design.",

        "This site was designed in 2012 and since then hasn't recieved a graphical update. Although the design hasn't been updated, this site has served as a study project for me to learn new technologies. I update it with a new framework almost every year and prioritise site load and accessibility. At the moment Dix Cottage is a static generated site with Gatsby and GraphQL queries. The client, Isobel, was clear in her brief that she wanted her site to reflect the calm, beautiful appearance of her holiday cottages, but support the largest audience possible. A static generated site was perfect for this application because of the reduced load on mobile devices and overal site download size. Gatsby's image plugin was useful to asynchronously serve correctly sized images. Gatsby's Netlify CMS plugin was useful to build a simple CMS for Isobel to update her cottage's reviews.",

Starting with the logo gave clear direction to the other tasks; whilst staying consistent with the company image. The finished business card, designed in Illustrator CS6, can be seen above. The web design stage was completed very quickly because the client requested that I base my design on a WordPress template she had bought for an old project. Although I would have liked more freedom, I stuck to the client’s brief. Since the project, the client has closed her site so it is unable to visit or view.",

Start-Up Stamford's founder, Martin Fox, gave me the brief to create their website. He desired an attractive, modern site, which can easily be used and run by young people. The purpose of the site was to explain the background of the competition, and provide a platform on which contestants can enter. I started the project with WordPress as I knew this is the CMS that the website manager will be familiar with. Normally I like to program original code and widgets, but as someone else would be managing the site after me, I opted to use WordPress plugins. This was to keep the admin interface as clean and simple as possible. After installing a basic theme, I added parallax scrolling elements, extra jQuery and my own child style sheet. I plan to update the site now my skills are more developed, to remove all bugs.",

I was offered the project when new owners acquired the shop and wanted to modernise some aspects. Working directly with a graphic designer, we were given the task of creating a suitable logo and matching site. Because the client originally wanted the freedom to update their content, a CMS was required. Originally I chose Wordpress and modifiied a basic theme to fit the design influences from the logo. Recently I have started updating The English Bookshop. The client has contacted me again and given me complete control of the design. This gives me freedom to try something more creative! I will be using this project as a study project to further my native CSS animation skills and mobile optimisation. I will be using Gatsby with React, and styled-components.

        "This one-page site was completed as an application task for a marketing agency that I applied for a job in England before moving to Netherlands. I had just turned 18 and this was my first professional CSS task. I was given a screen shot and had to try and replicate it as closely as I could with CSS; adding other features and styling if necessary. Every component of this site was written by myself. Without the use of any framework or CMS, I was able to create my own parallax scrolling layout and CSS animations. This allowed me great freedom in the way I would display content or combat a bug. I am particularly happy with my use of transparency and CSS animations in this site. Different colour overlays and images create beautiful effects when scrolling. Although the marketing agency was impressed, I didn’t accept the job because I chose to relocate to the Netherlands.",

The purpose of the site was a central hub for their fans and a marketing tool to win more gigs. They requested their own content management but stressed computer illiteracy. I realised that the band was already uploading media and content, but onto existing sites. For example, they uploaded all their music to bandcamp and all their gig dates to their google calendar. Because of this I was able to avoid WordPress as the CMS and write all the layout and styling from scratch, but embedding applets from different sites to display their media. This was ideal for me because it gave me more flexibility to practice my skills creating the perfect design. It also made it easier for the band to update their media. I am proud of the unique layout of this site and believe it fitted their design criteria perfectly. This site isn't online anymore as the band as split up.",
